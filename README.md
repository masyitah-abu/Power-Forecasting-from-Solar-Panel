# Power Forecasting from Solar Panel

In this work, the power from the solar panel will be forecast using Artificial Neural Network

There are several code prepared 
- loaddata = To load all current and voltage data collect from solar panel 
- 4 ANN code with different activation function is prepared to see the performance 
  - liner = linear
  - tansig
  - rbff
  -
